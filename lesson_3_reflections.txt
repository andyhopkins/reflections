When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	If you are working from multiple locations or collaborating with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If multiple users are contributing, you may have lots of changes all the time
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	forks are similar to clones but are only at GitHub and they reference the original repository that they were forked from,
	Clones are  copies of a repository either local or remote and branches are new streams within a repository.
	Forks would be used to clone and share a github repository with your changes and do not affect the original. clones are 
	used to copy a complete repository for working offline, and branches used for testing new functionality.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	You can check for conflicts before merging
